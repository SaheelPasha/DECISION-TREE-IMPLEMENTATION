# DESCRIPTION

# Project Description: Decision Tree Implementation using Scikit-learn
This project is about using a Decision Tree, which is a simple and popular method in machine learning, to predict or classify data. I used Python and a library called Scikit-learn to create and show the decision tree. The goal of this task is to help to understand how to build and use machine learning models and explain how they work.

# About the Dataset
I used a very famous dataset called the Iris dataset. It contains information about three types of iris flowers. For each flower, I has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Based on these, I want the model to guess which type of flower it is — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. This dataset is often used to learn and practice machine learning because it is small and easy to understand.

# Steps to Build the Model
First, I loaded the dataset. Then I split it into two parts: one part to train the model and the other part to test the model. This helps  check how well the model works on new data it hasn’t seen before.

I use a tool called DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn. This tool helps to build the decision tree. I choose the method called entropy which tells the model how to split the data in the best way. The model tries to make the most useful decisions at every step of the tree.

# Training and Testing
Once the tree is built using the training data, I then test it using the testing data. I check how well it performs by using something called accuracy score and a classification report. These scores tell  how many predictions were correct and how good the model is at telling one flower from another.

# Showing the Tree
One of the best parts of using a decision tree is that I can actually see it like a real tree. I use a tool called plot_tree() to draw it. This drawing shows how the model makes choices — which feature it checks first, how it splits the data, and how it reaches the final answer. It helps to understand the model better.

# What We Learned
Through this project, I saw that decision trees are easy to understand and use. They don’t need special steps like scaling the data. But sometimes they can overfit, which means they remember the training data too well and don’t work as well on new data.

In my project, the decision tree worked very well and gave correct results most of the time. This shows that decision trees are strong tools for small tasks like this.

# Final Thoughts
This project helped me to learn the basics of machine learning in a very simple and clear way.I now understand how to prepare data, train a model, test it, and check how well it works. I also learned how to explain a model by drawing it. This project is a great start and will help to move on to bigger and more advanced topics in machine learning later.
